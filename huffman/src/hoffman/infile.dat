Dear Students,

Thank you for participating in todays's meeting. A few issues for next steps.

- Team form
I have collected most team forms. If your team has not submitted the
form, please give to me this Thursday or Friday, next week Monday or
Tuesday.

- Team web site
Each team creates a web site, using https://sites.google.com
See examples from last year,
http://web.stevens.edu/wireless/reg/2014/

- Quad Chart
Each team creates a Quad Chart (pdf file) and posts on your web site.
A Quad Chart includes four parts, (1) A diagram/picture of your
project, (2) Project idea and applications, (3) Project challenges,
(4) Team member list, skills required, project schedule, deliverables
